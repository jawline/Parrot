!=!=! Intro: Start
Dawn is a x86 based operating system (OS) with a process scheduler, virtual memory manager, application loader, a defined set of system calls and a host of other features. This project was undertaken as part of an optional A-level module. The project involved development of a operating system kernel and a set of utility programs, as well as the design of a set of tools designed for the OS which allow the user to interact and perform tasks. The code was primarily written in C (C99), with small amounts of assembly used in the Kernel, as well as some bash or python scripts to automate compilation and deployment of the OS.

In 2014 I began working on the project again, refactoring the older code so that it complies with more modern programming standards and adding new features. I am continuing to work on the project, along with one other developer, to improve the existing code and experiment with potential kernel and OS designs.

The project is now available on github <a href="http://www.github.com/jawline/Dawn/">here</a>.
